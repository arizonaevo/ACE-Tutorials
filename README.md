# ACE-Tutorials
Here is a collection of the workflows and tutorials that are taught throughout the semester to the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center's (ACE) scholars group.

The tutorials collected here span topics from phylogenetic models, biometry, RNA seq, data visualizations, database manipulation and management, and random topics
I come across that I think may be useful to students.

As often as I can I provide datasets to be used with the tutorials but since much of our data is under embargo I have randomized many of the values. Therefore, any datasets included in this repository should be used as examples only, not actual analyses.
